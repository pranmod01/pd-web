Things to do for Django Review Work:

Django Intro:
1. Go through previously covered Django videos and take some video notes when I have time
2. Do "Time Display" activity
3. Do "Random Word Generator" activity
4. Do "Survey Form" activity
5. Do "Session Words (Optional)" activity
6. Do "Amadon" activity

Creating a New Django Project:
1. Create a virtual environment in VEfolder (optional) --> python -m virtualenv djangoEnv
	--> call djangoEnv/Scripts/activate (to activate; I did not do this)
	NOTE: every time you make a Django project, activate this VE
2. Create a project: (note touch == nul>)
	1. django-admin startproject [project_name]
	2. cd [project_name]
	3. mkdir apps
	4. cd apps
	5. touch __init__.py --> lets py interp know that app folder is present + other py modules can look in this directory + access files
	6. manage.py --> auto-created --> used in calling specific operations
	7. Starting a new app:
		1. In apps folder: python ../manage.py startapp [name_of_app]
		2. In settings.py: add apps.[name_of_app] into INSTALLED_APPS
3. URLs Routing + Views:
	1. In urls.py in main file, we can reroute URLS into our different apps to be handled (more broken down)
		1. from django.conf.urls import url, include
		2. from django.contrib import admin
	2. url(r'^', include('apps.[app_name].urls')) in urlpatterns = [1st, 2nd, etc...]
	3. touch urls.py in app directory
	4. In app directory urls.py: url(r'^[additional_url_stuff]$', views.[method_name])
		1. from django.conf.urls import url --> gives access to url()
		2. from . import views --> explicitly improts views.py in current folder
		3. url(r'^$', views.index (or other)) --> like @app.route
			NOTE: r: tells python to interp following as raw string; $ ends the string
		4. url() takes also name='[something]' --> later w/ NAMED ROUTES
4. views.py == where requests/responses/stuff get processed
--> Ex: from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse, redirect
		def index(request):
			response = "something"
			return HttpResponse(response)
NOTE: uses Regex in URL routing: regexr.com
	Ex: 1. '^' Matches the following characters at the beginning of a string. Example: '^a' matches 'anna' but not 'banana'.
		2. '$' Matches the previous characters at the end of a string. Example: 'a$' matches 'anna' and 'banana' but not 'fan'.
		3. '[]' Matches any value in a range. Example: '[0-9]' matches '9' and '9s'.
		4. '{n}' Matches n number or more repetitions of the preceding pattern. Example: '[0-9]{2}' matches '91' and '9834' but not '9'
		5. \d Matches digits.  Example: "\d" matches "8" and "877x"
		6. \d+ matches a string with one or more digits
		7. \w Matches characters.
		8 \w+ matches a string with one or more character/word
	Ex: 1. url(r'^articles/(?P\d+)$', views.show)
		2. url(r'^articles/(?P\w+)$', views.show_word)
		3. url(r'^articles/2003/$', views.special_case_2003)
		4. url(r'^articles/(?P[0-9]{4})$', views.year_archive)
		5. url(r'^articles/(?P[0-9]{4})/(?P[0-9]{2}$', views.month_archive)

Django:
ORMs (Object Relational Mappers):
1. Models are classes connected to the database
	1. Instead of being SQL queries, they're objects linked together that lets Django create the SQL query themselves
2. Purpose is to make simple join/link SQL queries faster and more concisely
3. More complicated statements, directly write a query

Models/Migrations:
Models:
- classes written in models.py
	1. from django.db import models
	2. class [Class Name] (models.Model):
	3. Add the fields
	4. All column (data) types can be found here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/
- These act as the database types/objects (i.e. what's stored)
- Map out the information that each should store
- Also here is where you'll map out the different relations (one-to-one; many-to-one; one-to-many, etc...)
NOTE: every time the database changes (i.e. new information is added, fields are changed, etc...), CREATE A MIGRATION
- Creating a migration basically puts whatever changes we had to any data into the database (sqlite)
1. Go to main directory in project
2. Run python manage.py makemigrations --> staging; Django looks at our code, finds changes, and formulates the correct Python code to actually do the migration
3. Run python manage.py migrate --> actually applies No. 2; where SQL queries are built and is equivalent to forward engineering an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

NOTES:
1. NEVER delete migration files!
2. ALWAYS run migrations every time there is a COMPLETE change in models.py (i.e. won't immediately delete; you can always revert!)
3. SQLite is fast and locally stored; good for development
4. Django ORM models and queries will ALWAYS be the same no matter which database is being used.

Foreign Key Relationships:
- One-to-many relationships are done using the ForeignKey field
	--> Ex: class Author(models.Model): ...
	--> class Book(models.Model):
			...
			author = models.ForeignKey(Author, related_name="books")
		--> One author can have many books
		--> Info about a book's author can be accessed as: some_book.author
		--> To create a record that this has a foreign key relationship, you pass it into the create function:
			--> Ex: this_author = Author.objects.get(id=2)
				my_book = Book.objects.create(title="Little Women", author=this_author)

				#also in one line:
				--> my_book = Book.objects.create(title="Little Women", author=Author.objects.get(id=2))
- Joins are done automatically (i.e. you don't have to run any additional queries to get info about the author)
- Searching off a ForeignKey relationship:
	--> Ex: this_author = Author.objects.get(id=2)
		books = Book.objects.filter(author=this_author)

		#one-line version:
		--> books = Book.objects.filter(author=Author.objects.get(id=2))
- Searching by a field in related object w/ double underscore:
	--> Ex: books = Books.objects.filter(author__name="Louise May Alcott")
	--> Ex: books = Book.objects.filter(author__name__startswith="Lou")
- Reverse Look-Ups:
	- Done w/ related_name field
	--> Ex: w/ related_name field, Django placed that field on the author to hold info about all of their books
		--> def index(request):
				context = {"authors": Author.objects.all()}
				return render(request, "books/index.html", context)
	- V. useful when calling data to be displayed on the template

Many-to-Many Relationships:
- To use m-m relationships in SQL, must create 3rd linked table w/ foreign key relationships to 2 other tables
- Django: if model includes ManyToManyField, auto-construct
--> Ex: class Book(models.Model): ...
--> class Publisher(models.Model):
		...
		books = models.ManyToManyFidle(Book, related_name="publishers")
	--> b/c each publisher can publish many books + every book can be published by many publishers
	--> DOES NOT MATTER (unlike FKey) which model has the MTMF --> Book model could've had field publishers instead (publishers = models.MTMF(Publisher, related_name="books")) 
- Adding a relationship btw 2 existing records:
	--> Ex: this_book = Book.objects.get(id=4)
		this_publisher = Publisher.objects.get(id=2)
		this_publisher.books.add(this_book)
- See all books from a publisher is SAME as a reverse look-up on FKey relationship --> this_publisher.books.all() in views.py or this_publisher_books.all in template
NOTE: MTMF are automatically symmetrical: anything added to one side is automatically added to the other side

Django Shell:
1. python manage.py shell --> starts shell
2. from apps.[APP_NAME].models import * --> imports all classes from that part: from apps.Blogs.models import *
3. Play around and manipulate database w/ commands from ORM commands: http://learn.codingdojo.com/m/13/4554/34000
NOTE: def __str__ or __repr__ to handle print results for more readable results:
--> def __str__/__repr__(self):
		return "... {}... {}".format(self.[param], self.[param2], etc...)
